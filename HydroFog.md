# HydroFog: Acoustic-Aware Fog Fabric for Autonomous Undersea Communication in Contested Environments (DDIL)

## Executive Summary

HydroFog is a proposed undersea communication **“fog fabric”** designed to enable resilient, secure, and adaptive networking among autonomous underwater systems in **degraded, disrupted, intermittent, and limited (DDIL)** conditions. It leverages an **acoustic-aware multi-modal communication architecture** combined with distributed (fog) computing to maintain connectivity in contested undersea environments. This approach addresses a critical AUKUS defense challenge: synchronizing and teaming multiple undersea vehicles and sensors with near real-time data exchange, even under adversarial interference or harsh ocean conditions [1]. HydroFog’s key innovations include: 

- A hybrid communication stack that uses **acoustic links** for long-range connectivity, augmented by **electromagnetic conduction, magnetic induction, and optical links** for high-speed data offload at short ranges. This ensures optimal bandwidth utilization and range adaptability in dynamic conditions.
- A **fog computing layer** that pushes computing and decision-making to underwater nodes (AUVs, UUVs, and smart buoys). By processing data locally and sharing essential information selectively, the network reduces latency and dependency on continuous links, enhancing operation in DDIL scenarios.
- An **adaptive communication strategy** for contested environments, including low probability of detection techniques (e.g. spread-spectrum acoustic signaling) and opportunistic use of surface or aerial relays to bridge undersea assets to command networks when needed.
- Robust **security and resilience** measures such as encryption, multi-path routing, and anti-jamming protocols, ensuring the undersea network remains functional and secure against eavesdropping or jamming attacks.

In summary, HydroFog provides AUKUS stakeholders a novel, unclassified solution to undersea communication that marries proven physics of underwater acoustics with modern networking and fog computing principles. It promises to maintain mission-critical connectivity among autonomous undersea systems and command centers, even when traditional communication means are denied or disrupted. This white paper outlines the background, technical architecture, communication model, use cases, risk assessment, integration plan, and roadmap for HydroFog – a foundation for a Stage 2 proposal to transform undersea communications in contested waters.

## Background

Underwater communication presents unique challenges and opportunities distinct from terrestrial or aerial networks. The underwater environment severely limits the effectiveness of traditional radio-frequency (RF) communications; radio waves generally cannot penetrate deeply through water, rendering technologies like Wi-Fi or satellite links ineffective for submerged assets. Instead, undersea networks have historically relied on **acoustic communication**, which uses sound waves traveling through water. Acoustic signals can propagate over kilometers underwater owing to water’s favorable acoustic properties, but they offer **low bandwidth and high latency** due to the slower speed of sound (~1500 m/s) compared to electromagnetic waves.

To overcome acoustic bandwidth limitations, researchers have explored alternative modalities like optical and electromagnetic methods. **Underwater optical communication** can support extremely high data rates (from Mbps to Gbps) with minimal latency, though its effective range is limited to tens of meters and requires line-of-sight conditions. **RF underwater communication** can work at very low frequencies to achieve longer ranges, but high frequencies experience severe attenuation in saline environments, limiting their use to very short distances or low data rates.

Innovative methods, such as **electromagnetic conduction** (which uses electrodes to transmit current through the conductive water medium) and **magnetic induction (MI)**, have been developed to fill niche roles – offering high data rates over very short ranges or moderate data rates over short distances while being more resilient to some forms of interference. These emerging technologies, along with advancements in acoustic and optical communications, form the basis for a multi-modal approach to underwater networking. This multi-modal approach is essential for achieving resilient, adaptive networks capable of operating in contested environments [1], [2], [3].

Furthermore, bridging the underwater-to-air communication gap is critical. Traditional solutions use surface buoys or tethers to relay data, but these are vulnerable in contested environments. Recent research has investigated direct air-water communication techniques that minimize surface exposure, thereby reducing detection risk [4].

## Problem Statement

Maintaining reliable undersea communication in a **contested, DDIL environment** is an unmet challenge for modern naval operations. Key issues include:

- **Limited Bandwidth and High Latency:** Acoustic channels, while long-ranged, offer only a few kilobits per second and incur significant propagation delays, hindering near-real-time coordination.
- **Intermittent Connectivity:** Underwater channels are subject to multipath fading, ambient noise, and occasional link dropouts due to environmental factors.
- **Adversary Interference:** In contested environments, adversaries may attempt to jam or intercept communications, compromising operational security and efficiency.
- **Surface Relay Vulnerabilities:** Reliance on surface nodes for bridging communications increases the risk of detection and targeting.
- **Ad Hoc Networking Challenges:** Without established infrastructure or GPS underwater, forming a robust, coordinated network among autonomous assets is inherently difficult.

HydroFog addresses these challenges by integrating multiple communication modalities with local fog computing, enabling nodes to adapt dynamically to changing conditions and maintain a secure, reliable network even under enemy jamming or harsh natural conditions.

## Technical Architecture

HydroFog’s architecture comprises three layers: the physical communication layer, the networking and data routing layer, and the fog computing layer.

### Node Types and Roles

- **Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)/UUVs:** Mobile platforms equipped with acoustic modems and computing units act as dynamic network nodes that both transmit and process data locally.
- **Seabed Sensors/Stations:** Fixed nodes that generate environmental or surveillance data and rely on nearby mobile nodes to relay information.
- **Relay Buoys/Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs):** Optional nodes that bridge underwater networks to above-water systems using RF or optical links when necessary.
- **Aerial Nodes:** UAVs or satellites can interface with surface relays to extend the communication reach to command centers.

### Communication Modalities

- **Acoustic Communication:** The backbone of the network, providing long-range, robust connectivity through multi-hop routing.
- **Optical Communication:** Used opportunistically for high-bandwidth data transfers between nodes in close proximity with clear line-of-sight.
- **Magnetic Induction/EM Conduction:** Employed for very short-range, high-speed data transfer, such as when an AUV docks with a seabed station.
- **RF Communication:** Activated only when a node surfaces or when a secure, covert relay is available, ensuring that critical data can be sent to C2 without prolonged surface exposure.

### Fog Computing Layer

Each HydroFog node runs a dedicated software stack that performs:
- **Local Data Processing:** Filtering and compressing raw sensor data to reduce communication load.
- **Distributed Command & Control:** Autonomous decision-making for task allocation and routing of critical messages.
- **Adaptive Network Management:** Continuous monitoring of channel conditions, dynamic switching between communication modes, and quality-of-service prioritization.
- **Caching and Store-and-Forward:** Temporary storage of data to bridge communication gaps during intermittent connectivity.

A conceptual diagram (see Figure 1) illustrates this multi-layered architecture, where underwater nodes communicate primarily via acoustic links while opportunistically switching to optical or conduction-based links when conditions allow.

*Figure 1. Conceptual HydroFog Network Architecture: Underwater vehicles and seabed sensors form an acoustic mesh (blue lines), with optional relay buoys linking to aerial or RF networks (red dashed lines).*

## Communication Strategy in Contested Environments

HydroFog’s communication strategy focuses on ensuring resilient and adaptive links under DDIL conditions by employing the following techniques:

1. **Multi-Modal Orchestration:**  
   - **Primary Acoustic Links:** Constant exchange of low-bandwidth heartbeat messages to maintain network awareness.
   - **High-Bandwidth Bursts:** Opportunistic optical or conduction-based transfers when nodes are close together.
   - **Adaptive Role Assignment:** Designating data ferry nodes to handle high-volume transfers when conditions permit.

2. **Low Probability of Intercept/Detection (LPI/LPD):**  
   - **Spread-Spectrum Techniques:** Frequency hopping to minimize detectability.
   - **Burst Transmission:** Short, intermittent data bursts reduce the exposure window.
   - **Directional Signaling:** Focused transmissions to limit leakage beyond intended recipients.
   - **Minimized Surface Exposure:** Strict protocols limit the time nodes spend surfaced, and when relays are used, they are designed to be transient.

3. **Jamming and Interference Mitigation:**  
   - **Frequency Agility:** Rapid switching among sub-bands to avoid jammed frequencies.
   - **Multi-Path Routing:** Rerouting data around jammed or interfered nodes.
   - **Robust Error Correction:** Using advanced error-correcting codes to recover from partial data loss.
   - **Adaptive Power Control:** Increasing transmit power selectively to overcome moderate interference.

4. **Prioritized Data Transmission:**  
   - **Quality of Service (QoS):** Critical control commands receive the highest priority and redundant transmission.
   - **Data Triage and Compression:** Non-critical data is buffered and compressed to ensure essential information gets through during periods of limited bandwidth.
   - **Store-and-Forward:** Data is cached until a reliable path to the destination becomes available.

A scenario example: During a mine countermeasure operation, if enemy jamming is detected, HydroFog’s nodes dynamically switch frequencies and reduce non-essential communications. AUVs in proximity establish an optical link to exchange high-resolution sonar images, while a designated relay AUV surfaces briefly at a safe distance to send an encrypted summary to the command center. This multi-layered response—enabled by HydroFog’s adaptive, multi-modal design—ensures that critical mission data is reliably transmitted even under hostile conditions.

## Use Cases

1. **Mine Countermeasure Operations:**  
   - A fleet of AUVs collaborates to detect and neutralize mines using coordinated acoustic communications. High-priority alerts are transmitted immediately, with optical bursts used for detailed imaging when vehicles come within close range. Relay nodes then ensure that data reaches command centers in near real-time.

2. **Covert ISR in Contested Waters:**  
   - UUVs monitor enemy harbor activities while maintaining a low profile. Using spread-spectrum acoustic techniques and directional signaling, they exchange tracking data and issue stealthy alerts without revealing their positions.

3. **Integration of Seabed Sensor Networks:**  
   - Seabed sensors connected via HydroFog automatically transmit critical environmental and surveillance data to passing AUVs, which then relay the aggregated data to command centers via secure, opportunistic RF links.

4. **Manned-Unmanned Teaming for ASW:**  
   - Manned submarines coordinate with multiple unmanned assets in anti-submarine warfare scenarios. HydroFog’s network enables rapid data sharing and dynamic task reallocation, ensuring that the fleet maintains a common operational picture even under enemy jamming.

5. **Rapid Environmental Assessment and HA/DR:**  
   - In disaster response scenarios where undersea cables are damaged, HydroFog enables temporary networks among deployed UUVs and sensor nodes, providing critical situational awareness through a resilient, self-organizing network.

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**  
- **Bandwidth Limitations:** Mitigated by prioritizing critical data and using multi-modal switching to optimize available bandwidth.
- **Multi-Modal Integration Complexity:** Addressed through extensive laboratory testing and fallback routines if one mode fails.
- **Hardware Reliability:** Ensured by incorporating redundancy, rigorous environmental testing, and using proven COTS components.

**Operational Risks:**  
- **Detection by Adversaries:** Minimized by LPI/LPD techniques, burst transmissions, and directional signaling.
- **Active Jamming:** Mitigated by frequency agility, multi-path routing, and robust error correction.
- **Environmental Variability:** Addressed through adaptive algorithms that continuously adjust comm parameters based on real-time channel assessments.

**Security Risks:**  
- **Eavesdropping and Spoofing:** Prevented with strong end-to-end encryption, digital signatures, and secure authentication protocols.
- **Node Compromise:** Mitigated by secure key management and the ability for nodes to zeroize sensitive data upon tampering detection.
- **Software Vulnerabilities:** Reduced through rigorous testing, agile update mechanisms, and robust fail-safe design.

Export compliance is straightforward (classified as EAR99 or 5A992 if no encryption). | High-capacity SSD/NVMe (1–2 TB) with AES encryption support for secure data at rest. Housed alongside the processor in an aluminum pressure vessel. Ensures ample logging capacity for high-resolution sonar, video, and sensor fusion data collected during multi-hour mid-depth missions. Emphasis on radiation tolerance and error-correcting code (ECC) memory in case of extended deployments. Data can be offloaded acoustically in summary form or recovered physically. | Extended capacity storage (≥2 TB, e.g. solid-state drive array or tape memory) for long-term deep-sea nodes. Deep deployments rely on infrequent retrieval, so nodes like Sonardyne Fetch use SD cards to log multi-year datasets ([Fetch - Sonardyne](https://www.sonardyne.com/product/fetch/#:~:text=Smart%20power%20management%20means%20the,memory%20card%20ready%20for%20retrieval)). Memory is typically managed by redundant recording (dual cards) to mitigate any single-point failure. Vendors offer pressure-tolerant memory modules that survive full ocean depth, often conformal-coated and potted for reliability. |
| **Power System**         | Lithium-ion battery packs (rechargeable) – e.g. 14.8 V, 18 Ah packs in pressure-balanced casings (Blue Robotics battery, 100 m rated) for AUVs/ROVs. Provide a few hours of operation; easily swapped at surface ([Hovering AUV](https://frostlab.byu.edu/hovering-auv#:~:text=,steadily%20in%20most%20underwater%20environments)). For fixed shallow nodes, solar charging via a surface buoy or periodic retrieval for recharge is feasible. Chemistries are UN38.3 certified for transport. Endurance: on the order of 8–24 hours continuous use for mobile units, or weeks for duty-cycled sensors. | Lithium-ion polymer battery modules (oil-compensated or in 1000 m aluminum housings) – typical pack capacity ~1–2 kWh. For example, an AUV may carry ~4× 266 Wh lithium packs ([Hovering AUV](https://frostlab.byu.edu/hovering-auv#:~:text=,steadily%20in%20most%20underwater%20environments)). Endurance ranges from 12–48 hours depending on mission profile. Alternatively, Lithium primary cells (e.g. Li–SOCl<sub>2</sub>) are used in one-way drifters or profiling floats for months-long life. All components must be NATO safety certified (thermal runaway protection, etc.). | High-capacity primary lithium battery banks – used in deep ocean sensor nodes to achieve multi-year endurance. Sonardyne’s **Fetch** node offers up to *10-year* battery life with a custom high-capacity battery pack ([Fetch - Sonardyne](https://www.sonardyne.com/product/fetch/#:~:text=Fetch%20your%20subsea%20data)). These packs use lithium thionyl chloride or lithium sulfuryl chloride cells, which have high energy density and low self-discharge. No maintenance charging needed. Deep AUVs (if manned or large UUVs) sometimes employ aluminum-oxygen fuel cells or pressure-tolerant lithium-ion batteries to extend range, but those are specialized. All deep power systems are pressure-balanced or housed in titanium to avoid casing implosion. |
| **Enclosure & Connectors** | Acrylic or polycarbonate housings (o-ring sealed) for electronics – lightweight and sufficient for <100 m (typical rating ~100 m ([BlueROV2 - Affordable and Capable Underwater ROV - Blue Robotics](https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/#:~:text=BlueROV2%20,The))). For example, BlueROV2 uses an acrylic electronics tube rated to 100 m ([BlueROV2 - Affordable and Capable Underwater ROV - Blue Robotics](https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/#:~:text=BlueROV2%20,The)). Quick-release anodized aluminum end-caps allow easy access. Connectors: plastic push-connect or SubConn Micro series for shallow use (PEEK bodies, depth tested to 300 m). All materials resist corrosion in salt/brackish water (no galvanic couples). | Hard anodized aluminum alloy enclosures – depth-rated to ~1000 m. Common form factor is a cylindrical housing with double O-rings. Aluminum offers a good strength-to-weight ratio for mid-depth; wall thickness is sized for ~100 bar. Connectors: MacArtney SubConn standard circular connectors (several pins) with chloroprene rubber seals, typically certified to ~3000 m ([SubConn High Power - 4 contacts - MacArtney](https://www.macartney.com/connectivity/subconn/subconn-power-series/subconn-high-power-4-contacts/#:~:text=Depth%20rating%20PEEK%3A%20300%20bar%2C,steel%2C%20titanium%20or%20anodised)) (extra safety at 1000 m). For higher pin count or fiber, Teledyne SEACON wet-mate connectors are used (oil-filled, depth-rated ~4000 m) ([TE Debuts New Wet-Mate Connector - Marine Technology News](https://www.marinetechnologynews.com/news/debuts-connector-547937#:~:text=TE%20Debuts%20New%20Wet,The%20connector)). All exposed metal is anodized or 316 SS to prevent corrosion. | Titanium alloy or duplex stainless steel pressure housings – required for >1000 m to withstand extreme pressures (e.g. 6000 m rated titanium pods used in ARGO floats). Titanium is preferred for its high strength and corrosion immunity over decades. Connectors: MacArtney SubConn or SEA-CON *full-ocean-depth* series. Notably, SubConn circular connectors have versions tested to 11,000 m ([

            ](https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/13343#:~:text=All,PBOF%20and%20Shuttle%20Pin)), and TE Connectivity’s SEACON *All-Wet* series to ~13,700 m ([

            ](https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/13343#:~:text=All,PBOF%20and%20Shuttle%20Pin)). Penetrators use glass-to-metal seals or compensated oil to equalize pressure. Deep enclosures often include redundant seals and external pressure sensors for leak detection, given the criticality of avoiding water ingress. |

**Table 1: Recommended export-compliant COTS hardware for the HydroFog undersea network, by operational depth environment.** Models listed have prior use in defense/maritime projects or meet NATO (e.g., JANUS acoustic communications) standards. Export notes: all items are commercially available to AUKUS partners; sensitive technologies (e.g. certain high-speed acoustic modems) may require export licenses ([Ordering :: Acoustic Communications Group](https://acomms.whoi.edu/micro-modem/ordering/#:~:text=At%20the%20request%20of%20WHOI%2C,and%20at%20risk%20of%20user)), but wherever possible, we highlight non-ITAR alternatives.

## Depth-Specific Considerations

### Shallow Water (<100 m)

Shallow-water deployments benefit from relatively benign pressure conditions but face challenges like biofouling, high ambient noise, and multipath from surface/bottom reflections. **Acoustic modems** in this zone can use higher frequencies for greater data bandwidth since range requirements are shorter. For example, EvoLogics S2C modems in plastic (Delrin) housings are well-suited here, offering several kbps throughput and supporting the NATO **JANUS** open protocol ([](https://www.evologics.com/product/attachments/s2c-modems-brochure-49#:~:text=MULTI%EF%9A%BAPROTOCOL%20SUPPORT%20Besides%20EvoLogics%20S2C%2C,and%20SWiG%20underwater%20communication%20protocols)). Lightweight, low-power modems facilitate mesh networking among UUVs and diver units, and they are generally ITAR-free (European or commercial origin). On the computing side, small **edge processors** like NVIDIA Jetson modules allow AI tasks (e.g. target recognition or adaptive routing) to be performed in-node ([CUREE Robot Dives Deep with Deep Learning | NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coral-reef-decline-curee-robot-jetson-isaac-omniverse/#:~:text=The%20WARPLab%20autonomous%20underwater%20vehicle,the%20tide%20on%20reef%20declines)). These COTS boards have been demonstrated in shallow reef monitoring AUVs ([CUREE Robot Dives Deep with Deep Learning | NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coral-reef-decline-curee-robot-jetson-isaac-omniverse/#:~:text=The%20WARPLab%20autonomous%20underwater%20vehicle,the%20tide%20on%20reef%20declines)), and even hobbyist boards (Raspberry Pi, etc.) can handle less intensive tasks, lowering costs. Environmental **sensors** in shallow waters must endure biofouling and turbidity – hence the inclusion of turbidity meters and robust CTDs. Plastic-bodied CTDs (Sea-Bird or RBR) are sufficient and avoid corrosion. **Power systems** in littoral nodes are often modular: rechargeable battery packs that can be swapped or topped up via a tether to a solar buoy. Because intervention is easiest at shallow depths, designers can prioritize convenience (quick-release enclosures, easy connector mates) and shorter service intervals. Off-the-shelf acrylic housings rated to ~100 m are popular ([BlueROV2 - Affordable and Capable Underwater ROV - Blue Robotics](https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/#:~:text=BlueROV2%20,The)), trading off some durability for cost and transparency (useful for optical diagnostics). Connectors with plastic or lower-grade metal (bronze, aluminum) are acceptable, as the risk of galvanic corrosion is lower in short-term deployments; these connectors simplify diver servicing and reduce expense for large numbers of networked shallow nodes.

### Mid-Depth (100–1000 m)

Mid-depth operations (continental shelf to upper slope) introduce higher pressure (10–100 bar) and colder, darker conditions. Hardware here requires more ruggedization. **Acoustic communication** must balance range and bandwidth: mid-frequency modems (10–30 kHz band) are typically used, achieving several kilometers range at a few kbps ([](https://www.teledynemarine.com/en-us/products/SiteAssets/Benthos_Modem_PSG.pdf#:~:text=Frequency%20%2F%20Typical%20Range2%20Wide,FH%20transmit%2Freceive)). For instance, Teledyne Benthos ATM series modems rated around 1000–2000 m provide a good fit, as they have configurable power levels and support networked protocols (some even implement the JANUS standard for NATO interoperability ([A new era of digital underwater communications - NATO.int](https://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natohq/news_143247.htm?selectedLocale=en#:~:text=A%20new%20era%20of%20digital,farms%20and%20pipelines%2C%20or))). These modems have a track record in AUV and subsea infrastructure communications. Export-wise, many are dual-use items under U.S. EAR (e.g. ECCN 5A001 for advanced ones ([Ordering :: Acoustic Communications Group](https://acomms.whoi.edu/micro-modem/ordering/#:~:text=At%20the%20request%20of%20WHOI%2C,and%20at%20risk%20of%20user))), but available to allies with proper licensing. **Onboard computing** at mid-depth often means more powerful processors in pressure housings – for example, a 1 TFLOPS-class Jetson AGX or an x86-based SBC, allowing local sensor processing and machine learning. Such systems have been integrated into mid-depth AUVs alongside FPGAs for real-time tasks ([Hovering AUV](https://frostlab.byu.edu/hovering-auv#:~:text=Our%20vehicle%20is%20equipped%20with,steadily%20in%20most%20underwater%20environments)). The fog computing approach means these nodes collaborate to process data (e.g. a group of AUVs mapping an area can share target detection results), reducing bandwidth strain on the acoustic links. **Sensors** in this range are typically the same oceanographic-grade instruments used by research vessels: CTDs with aluminum or titanium housings (ensuring accuracy down to ~1000 m), and DVLs or ADCPs for navigation and current profiling. Notably, a mid-depth DVL like Teledyne’s Pioneer (rated 1000 m) is commonly integrated into AUVs – this provides reliable bottom-lock navigation up to ~200 m altitude ([Pioneer DVL - Teledyne Marine](https://www.teledynemarine.com/brands/rdi/pioneer-doppler-velocity-logs#:~:text=Specifications%20%3B%20%E2%80%8BMax%20Ping%20Rate%2C,1000m%2C%206000m%20%3B%20Standard%20Sensors%E2%80%8B)), crucial for tasks like mine countermeasures or sub-sea pipeline inspection. **Data storage** needs grow at mid-depth because these nodes can collect large volumes (high-res sonar, video) on multi-hour missions. Hence, we recommend high-capacity SSDs with ruggedization (some vendors offer fully potted, hermetically sealed SSDs for subsea use ([Foremay SSD | High-Performance Industrial Drives | Nexus](https://nexusindustrialmemory.com/foremay-ssd/#:~:text=%2A%20Into%20the%20Unknown%3A%20Radiation,meet%20your%20unique%20mission%20requirements))). Mid-depth deployments might offload data acoustically to a surface buoy in increments, but given acoustic bandwidth limits, most data is stored onboard for retrieval. **Power** is a significant constraint – mid-depth AUVs often run on lithium-ion packs giving ~12–24 h endurance. Safe operation and export compliance of batteries require adherence to marine safety standards (similar battery chemistries are already used in NATO UUV programs). Pressure-tolerant designs (oil-filled packs or pressure-proof casings) become important around this depth to avoid heavy housings. **Enclosures** move from plastics to metals: anodized aluminum is a workhorse here for electronics pods, offering depth capability to a few thousand meters while being easier to machine and relatively low cost. Connectors are typically the SubConn or SEACON types proven in offshore industry – these facilitate component modularity (e.g., swapping a sensor module) and are built to NATO naval standards for reliability. Mid-depth connectors and enclosures must handle more severe corrosion potential (cold seawater is oxygen-rich and can corrode metals quickly), so high-grade alloys and frequent maintenance (greasing, freshwater rinse) are part of the operational routine.

### Deep Water (>1000 m)

Deep water and abyssal deployments demand the most stringent hardware choices, akin to those used in deep-diving submersibles and long-term moorings. **Pressure** is the overriding factor – at 1000 m and beyond, even small flaws can lead to catastrophic failure. **Acoustic modems** for deep water prioritize range and robustness over speed. Low-frequency acoustics (around 9–14 kHz) can communicate over many kilometers ([](https://www.teledynemarine.com/en-us/products/SiteAssets/Benthos_Modem_PSG.pdf#:~:text=Frequency%20%2F%20Typical%20Range2%20Wide,27%20kHz%29%20%2F%E2%89%A5%202%20km)), albeit at tens of bits per second in reliable mode. Thus, selected modems (e.g. Benthos ATM-966 or Sonardyne’s deep-rated modems) use low frequencies and strong error correction. While their high-speed modes are export-controlled, they can often be supplied in export-compliant configurations; moreover, NATO’s JANUS standard ensures even basic connectivity between any allied units ([NATO - News: Les communications numériques sous-marines entrent dans une nouvelle ère, 27-Apr.-2017](https://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natohq/news_143247.htm?selectedLocale=en#:~:text=The%20NATO%20Science%20and%20Technology,many%20exciting%20underwater%20communication%20applications)). Deep ocean fog computing nodes likely act as periodic data aggregators rather than real-time processors, due to limited comms. Still, each node may host an onboard computer to compress data, make autonomy decisions (e.g., a seafloor station deciding when to transmit an event detection), or run AI models on local sensor feeds. Reliability is key: radiation-hardened, *power-efficient* CPUs or FPGAs are chosen to minimize heat and ensure multi-year operation without reboot. **Environmental sensors** at depth are usually top-of-the-line: full ocean depth CTDs (often titanium-housed) and reference hydrophones used in international monitoring networks. These have to maintain calibration stability over possibly years (deep CTDs like SBE 61 have <0.002 °C/year drift). A deep node might omit turbidity unless near the seabed, but if included, the sensor must survive extreme pressures – fortunately, products like the Seapoint turbidity meter are tested to 6000 m and constructed from incompressible materials ([](http://www.seapoint.com/pdf/stm_um.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Temperature%20Coefficient%3A%20,Rigid%20polyurethane%20plastic%20and%20epoxy)). **Data storage** for deep deployments leans towards “store-and-forward” logging. As an example, **Sonardyne Fetch** seafloor nodes log data internally (on SD cards) and only send summaries via acoustics until physically retrieved ([Fetch - Sonardyne](https://www.sonardyne.com/product/fetch/#:~:text=Smart%20power%20management%20means%20the,memory%20card%20ready%20for%20retrieval)). We recommend similar high-capacity, low-power storage with redundancy (two copies of data in case one fails over years). For **power**, deep nodes often use primary (non-rechargeable) batteries to achieve maximum energy density. Lithium primary batteries used in deep-sea instruments are export-friendly (they are common commercial items), but their shipment and handling require adherence to safety regulations. The 10-year battery life of a Fetch node ([Fetch - Sonardyne](https://www.sonardyne.com/product/fetch/#:~:text=Fetch%20your%20subsea%20data)) underscores that deep deployments can be designed for extreme longevity, which is critical when retrieval is costly. Such longevity also aligns with AUKUS Pillar II goals of persistent underwater surveillance. Finally, **housings and connectors** at depth are typically titanium and oil-filled connector systems, respectively. Titanium enclosures (or pressure-balanced oil-filled electronics) eliminate depth limitations within the range of interest – e.g., a well-designed Ti pod can go to full ocean depth (around 11 km) with proper wall thickness and o-ring design. Connectors for deep water are often **wet-mateable** to allow ROVs to plug/unplug units underwater. Technologies from the offshore oil & gas domain (like Teledyne ODI Nautilus connectors, rated ~6400 m ([
                    Underwater Connectors | Encyclopedia MDPI
            ](https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/13343#:~:text=All,PBOF%20and%20Shuttle%20Pin)), or MacArtney 11,000 m SubConn) ensure that even at hadal depths, connections remain intact and leak-free. Special care is taken for corrosion: dissimilar metals are avoided or electrically isolated, and sacrificial anodes might be attached to deep nodes to protect critical components. Overall, deep-water hardware adheres to the highest military/industry standards (often the same gear used by navies in undersea surveillance or by oceanographic institutes), and thus is likely to meet AUKUS evaluators’ expectations for reliability and performance under extreme conditions.

### Export Compliance and NATO/AUKUS Standards

Across all depth regimes, the recommended components are **commercially available** and have been used by NATO or AUKUS members, ensuring a smoother export process. Many items (sensors, batteries, connectors) are classified as low-risk dual-use goods. Notably, underwater acoustic modems can trigger export controls if they employ advanced encryption or high data rate spread-spectrum techniques. The WHOI Micro-Modem, for instance, is categorized under ECCN 5A001.b.1.a (controlled for national security) ([Ordering :: Acoustic Communications Group](https://acomms.whoi.edu/micro-modem/ordering/#:~:text=At%20the%20request%20of%20WHOI%2C,and%20at%20risk%20of%20user)). In our recommendations, we emphasize models with known export-friendly status – for example, Evologics and Sonardyne modems which comply with the open JANUS standard and have been used in NATO exercises ([](https://www.evologics.com/product/attachments/s2c-modems-brochure-49#:~:text=MULTI%EF%9A%BAPROTOCOL%20SUPPORT%20Besides%20EvoLogics%20S2C%2C,and%20SWiG%20underwater%20communication%20protocols)) ([NATO - News: Les communications numériques sous-marines entrent dans une nouvelle ère, 27-Apr.-2017](https://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natohq/news_143247.htm?selectedLocale=en#:~:text=The%20NATO%20Science%20and%20Technology,many%20exciting%20underwater%20communication%20applications)). These are designed with interoperability in mind, a key requirement for AUKUS Pillar II cooperation. Additionally, using COTS hardware means much of the documentation and support is unclassified and openly available, which aids coalition integration. All suggested hardware either meets or aligns with **NATO STANAGs** (e.g. JANUS STANAG 4748 for acoustics, or STANAG 1364 which covers environmental durability of military materiel) and has been proven in relevant environments by organizations like WHOI, CMRE, and defense contractors. This ensures that the HydroFog system can be built rapidly and maintained with readily obtainable parts, while still achieving the resilience and capability required for advanced undersea operations.

**Sources:** The above recommendations and analyses reference manufacturer specifications and defense domain literature. For instance, Teledyne Benthos provides depth and bandwidth specs for acoustic modems ([](https://www.teledynemarine.com/en-us/products/SiteAssets/Benthos_Modem_PSG.pdf#:~:text=Frequency%20%2F%20Typical%20Range2%20Wide,FH%20transmit%2Freceive)), NATO CMRE outlines the JANUS acoustic protocol for interoperability ([NATO - News: Les communications numériques sous-marines entrent dans une nouvelle ère, 27-Apr.-2017](https://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natohq/news_143247.htm?selectedLocale=en#:~:text=The%20NATO%20Science%20and%20Technology,many%20exciting%20underwater%20communication%20applications)), NVIDIA and academic project reports demonstrate the use of AI-capable computing in underwater platforms ([CUREE Robot Dives Deep with Deep Learning | NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/coral-reef-decline-curee-robot-jetson-isaac-omniverse/#:~:text=The%20WARPLab%20autonomous%20underwater%20vehicle,the%20tide%20on%20reef%20declines)) ([Hovering AUV](https://frostlab.byu.edu/hovering-auv#:~:text=Our%20vehicle%20is%20equipped%20with,steadily%20in%20most%20underwater%20environments)), and Sonardyne details its long-life subsea nodes’ capabilities (battery endurance, acoustic links, etc.) ([Fetch - Sonardyne](https://www.sonardyne.com/product/fetch/#:~:text=Fetch%20your%20subsea%20data)) ([Fetch - Sonardyne](https://www.sonardyne.com/product/fetch/#:~:text=Smart%20power%20management%20means%20the,memory%20card%20ready%20for%20retrieval)). These sources and others have been cited to ensure accuracy and to show the pedigree of each component in real-world defense or research deployments. The result is a comprehensive, depth-tailored hardware suite for HydroFog that balances cutting-edge performance with reliability and export compliance – ready to support AUKUS collaborative undersea missions.
